This signature was created $timestamp
using the key $keyid

This text was sent as an email to PGP Digital Timestamping Service ($to) for 
stamping. The URL of this service is http://www.itconsult.co.uk/stamper.htm
The last PGP signature in this email text is a trusted timestamp from stamper.
The verification of this timestamp using stampers public key 
(http://www.itconsult.co.uk/stamper/stampinf.htm) followed by verification of 
GnuPrivacyGuard signature using $keyid proves the existence of the file
